This also allows all other programs running on that JVM to bind these ports.\n  Root - run GC as root. This also allows the GC server, its plugins and the JVM to do pretty much anything, including sending your nudes to the NSA, CIA, and the alphabet boys.\n  None - for no method. This requires you to change the GC Dispatch port."
